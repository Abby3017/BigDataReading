* [AsterixDB: A Scalable, Open Source BDMS] (http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p1905-alsubaiee.pdf)

AsterixDB is a new, full-function BDMS (Big Data Management
System) with a feature set that distinguishes it from other platforms
in today’s open source Big Data ecosystem. Its features make it
well-suited to applications like web data warehousing, social data
storage and analysis, and other use cases related to Big Data. AsterixDB has a flexible NoSQL style data model; a query language that supports a wide range of queries; a scalable runtime; partitioned,
LSM-based data storage and indexing (including B+ -tree, R-tree,
and text indexes); support for external as well as natively stored
data; a rich set of built-in types; support for fuzzy, spatial, and tem-
poral types and queries; a built-in notion of data feeds for ingestion
of data; and transaction support akin to that of a NoSQL store.

* [DataHub: Collaborative Data Science & Dataset Version Management at Scale] (http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0798)

Dataset Version Control System (DSVC), is a system for multi-
version dataset management. DSVC’s goal is to provide a common
substrate to enable data scientists to capture their modifications,
minimize storage costs, use a declarative language to reason about
versions, identify differences between versions, and share datasets
with other scientists. Second, DATAHUB, is a hosted platform
built on top of DSVC, that not only supports richer interaction ca-
pabilities, but also provides a number of novel tools for data clean-
ing, data search and integration, and data visualization tools.

* [Kafka: a Distributed Messaging System for Log Processing] (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/UM/people/srikanth/netdb11/netdb11papers/netdb11-final12.pdf):

Log processing has become a critical component of the data pipeline for consumer internet companies. We introduce Kafka, a distributed messaging system that we developed for collecting and delivering high volumes of log data with low latency. Our system incorporates ideas from existing log aggregators and messaging systems, and is suitable for both offline and online message consumption. We made quite a few unconventional yet practical design choices in Kafka to make our system efficient and scalable. Our experimental results show that Kafka has superi or performance when compared to two popular messaging systems. We have been using Kafka in production for some time and it is processing hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day.
